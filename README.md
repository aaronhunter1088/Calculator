# Calculator

This project is one of the few projects I have from college that I was able to keep.
It may look ancient but the goal of this project is to demonstrate my Java programming
skill and my UI skills, and my ability to come up with a somewhat professional design
and planning.

There will be several views to choose from.
The first 4 calculator views it will display are: Basic, Programmer, Scientific, and Date.
The next view, Converter, will itself implement various different units to convert between.

v1: Basic calculator is created and solidified.

v2: Calculator is broken apart, and thoroughly constructed to create more types, eliminate code
duplication, and I began to create a way for the classes to be written in such a way that it is
cleaner, more readable, and will set a standard for future classes. However, version2 was to be
developed using JavaFX and this was a failure. For whatever it just wasn't coming as intuitively
as I feel the programmers meant. So I will stick with programming by hand everything (even the UI).

v3: Programmer, Scientific, and Date calculators are all types to be implemented in version3.

v4. By this version, Basic, and Date are working as expected and Converter is in the works.
Programmer and Scientific are created but a lot of the logic is not there.
