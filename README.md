# calculator

This project was one of the only projects I have from college that I was able to keep. It may look ancient but the goal of this project is to demonstrate my Java programming skill and my UI skills, and my ability to come up with a somewhat professional design and planning.

There will be two modes, to my Calculator: Standard and Convert. 
Standard has 4 calculator types it can display: Basic, Programmer, Scientific, and Date
Convert has a lot of calculator types and this mode will be coming in v4.

version1: Basic calculator is created and solidified.

version2: Calculator is broken apart, and thoroughly constructed to create more types, eliminate code duplication, and I began to create a way for the classes to be written in such a way that it is cleaner, more readable, and will set a standard for future classes. However, version2 was to be developed using JavaFX and this was a failure. For whatever it just wasn't coming as intuitively as I feel the programmers meant. So I will stick with programming by hand everything (even the UI).

version3: Programmer, Scientific, and Date calculators are all types to be implemented in version3.
